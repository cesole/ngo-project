# CHILDREN OF ZAMBIA - Code Institute Milestone Project 4
Built by **_Cecilia Barriga_**

For this project I decided to create something new, rather than following the suggested projects.
I went with a NGOn known as 'Children of Zambia'. I created the logo myself, with help of Tailor Brands website, and changing the colors myself.

I created this site with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python using Django. The main focus of the site, is to get donations from user in order to help the children with education. 
I also created a News page where users can read about any news happening with the children. 


## UX
This application is intended for use by all, but mainly people that want to donate money to an NGO that helps Children in Zambia with their education, and at the end this will also help to reduce poverty. 


## WireFrames
Below are the wireframes for the project.
