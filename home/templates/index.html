            <p>
                Poverty, at its most extreme form, is destitution. It’s trying to survive without even the most basic of needs, like food, water or shelter. For sub-Saharan Africa, that’s the reality for almost half of the population. Africa is the poorest continent
                on earth by a long shot. With the exception of three, 28 of the poorest countries in the world are in Africa.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="education">Education</h4>
            <p>Of all regions, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of education exclusion. Over one-fifth of children between the ages of about 6 and 11 are out of school, followed by one-third of youth between the ages of about 12 and 14. According
                to UIS data, almost 60% of youth between the ages of about 15 and 17 are not in school.</p>
            <p>Without urgent action, the situation will likely get worse as the region faces a rising demand for education due to a still-growing school-age population.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Africa: a continent of children</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Half of the continent’s population is children, up to 20% of which are disabled.</li>
                <li>An ever-increasing number are growing up stunted because of the challenges of malnutrition.</li>
                <li>Diseases like HIV/AIDS are leaving kids orphaned and in charge of their households at very young ages. An estimated 50 million orphans live in Africa.</li>
                <li>Malaria kills 3,000 African children per day.</li>
                <li>With a population expected to more than double by 2050, even fewer resources will be available to go around without dramatic change.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Difficult conditions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The infrastructure that most of the world takes for granted is missing or severely limited in Africa. 589 million sub-Saharan Africans live without electricity and cook by burning whatever they can find.</li>
                <li>Water and sanitation issues cost these countries more than the total economic aid they receive. Of all of the people in the world without access to safe water, almost 40% live in Africa.</li>
                <li>Hunger is a major issue, and Africa is producing less food per person, with the average plot of land being too small to feed a family.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your support is an investment in the future, helping disadvantaged kids stay in school and complete their education. When you make a donation to our children, you provide the resources and opportunities children and youth need, from kindergarten
                through high school, and beyond.</p>
            <p>When they are enrolled in our sponsorship program, kids gain access to the educational tools they need to succeed, based on age, location and their own unique life circumstances. Keeping young children from falling behind early is critical
                to their academic success. Providing resources that keep them on track so they can graduate from high school is the next vital step. Then, as they graduate from our program, HOPE is there for them to continue their education. </p>
