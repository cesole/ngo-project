                    Poverty, at its most extreme form, is destitution. It’s trying to survive without even the most basic of needs, like food, water or shelter. For sub-Saharan Africa, that’s the reality for almost half of the population.
                    Africa is the poorest continent on earth by a long shot. With the exception of three, 28 of the poorest countries in the world are in Africa.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="education">Education</h4>
                <p>Of all regions, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of education exclusion. Over one-fifth of children between the ages of about 6 and 11 are out of school, followed by one-third of youth between 
                the ages of about 12 and 14. According to UIS data, almost 60% of youth between the ages of about 15 and 17 are not in school.</p> 
                <p>Without urgent action, the situation will likely get worse as the region faces a rising demand for education due to a still-growing school-age population.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Africa: a continent of children</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Half of the continent’s population is children, up to 20% of which are disabled.</li>
                    <li>An ever-increasing number are growing up stunted because of the challenges of malnutrition.</li>
                    <li>Diseases like HIV/AIDS are leaving kids orphaned and in charge of their households at very young ages. An estimated 50 million orphans live in Africa.</li>
                    <li>Malaria kills 3,000 African children per day.</li>
                    <li>With a population expected to more than double by 2050, even fewer resources will be available to go around without dramatic change.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>Difficult conditions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The infrastructure that most of the world takes for granted is missing or severely limited in Africa. 589 million sub-Saharan Africans live without electricity and cook by burning whatever they can find.</li>
                    <li>Water and sanitation issues cost these countries more than the total economic aid they receive. Of all of the people in the world without access to safe water, almost 40% live in Africa.</li>
                    <li>Hunger is a major issue, and Africa is producing less food per person, with the average plot of land being too small to feed a family.</li>
                </ul>
